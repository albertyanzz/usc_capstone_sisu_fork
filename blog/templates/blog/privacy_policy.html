                <h3>Your Privacy is Important to Us</h3>
                <p>It is Sisu's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating
                    our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="http://www.sisuvr.com/">www.sisuvr.com</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
                    "www.sisuvr.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
                    information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy
                    Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information,
                    and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy
                    applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of
                    information from other sources.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the
                    general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when
                    visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>

                <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
                <p>Like most website operators, Sisu collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that
                    web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
                    referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Sisu's purpose in collecting
                    non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Sisu's visitors use its website.
                    From time to time, Sisu may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.,
                    by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                <p>Sisu also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                    addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on www.sisuvr.com blog posts.
                    Sisu only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it
                    uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

                <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                <p>Certain visitors to Sisu's websites choose to interact with Sisu in ways that require Sisu to gather
                    personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Sisu gathers depends on
                    the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
                    https://www.sisuvr.com to provide a username and email address.</p>

                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
                    transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to
                    use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
                    absolute security.</p>

                <h3>Advertisements</h3>
                <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.
                    These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online
                    advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information
                    allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be
                    of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Sisu and does not cover
                    the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

                <h3>Links To External Sites</h3>
                <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third
                    party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the
                    Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
                <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices
                    of any third party sites, products or services.</p>

                <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
                <p>Sisu may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Sisu may display this
                    information publicly or provide it to others. However, Sisu does not disclose your
                    personally-identifying information.</p>


                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Sisu uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services
                    provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your
                    preferences on your computer.</p>
                <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the
                    visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Sisu uses cookies to help
                    Sisu identify and track visitors, their usage of www.sisuvr.com, and their website access
                    preferences. Sisu visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set
                    their browsers to refuse cookies before using Sisu's websites, with the drawback that certain
                    features of Sisu's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
                <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge
                    and agree to Sisu's use of cookies.</p>

                <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
                <p>If Sisu, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Sisu goes
                    out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
                    transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that
                    any acquirer of Sisu may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

                <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
                <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Sisu may change its Privacy Policy from time to time,
                    and in Sisu's sole discretion. Sisu encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any
                    changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy
                    Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>

                <h3>Credit & Contact Information</h3>
